![](typeOut.png)  

TypeOut is a speed typing game made using JavaScript,CSS and HTML.  

The quotes in this game are fetched from https://api.quotable.io/random.  
This project invovles javaScript concept like API FETCH and ASYN AWAIT.  

It also includes a feature that checks weather user input is correct (green coloured) or not (red coloured) along with a counter whose value changes dynamically based on quote length.
